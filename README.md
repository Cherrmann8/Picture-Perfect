# Picture-Perfect
Picture Perfect is an image indexing application built with python's Tkinter package. Python version 2.7. 

I sincerely apologize to anyone reading this. As this is my first "real" coding project, I tried my best to write clean, documented code.
But as all programmers know, that's easier said than done. 

Please feel free to take this code and make any edits or adjustments you see fit. All I ask is for a simple email or message, letting me know
where you think my code could be improved. Thank you.
